# Fine-tuned Models
This folder contains the models obtained by running the EVE training scripts and the UniRep evotune scripts. Due to the large file size generated by these scripts, they are omitted when comitting the GitHub repository. Please run **eve_train_submit.sh** and **unirep_evotune.sh** from the [submission folder](PRIZM/ModellerModule/submission) to obtain the necessary model files.
